Goals:

Unit tests are great, but sometimes we need system end-to-end tests to trigger
real-world production bugs in Nova. 

This was originally created to trigger race conditions and synchronization
bugs in Nova with regard to the layer-3 network plugin project. 

Short term goals:
1. A script that can fire up a ton of VMs, concurrently over a long period of time
2. A script that can verify that Nova security groups are implemented correctly
3. A script that can verify that a VM can't reach internal ops related resources

Future?
1. Cloud performance / profiling metrics
2. Analyzing accuracy of various scheduling algorithms
3. Find scaling boundaries 
4. Verify NAT operations
5. Record network and disk benchmarks at various loads
6. Blast various API calls to reach their breaking-points

Implementation:
-Python + Boto scripts 

Requirements:
- python
- boto
- a Nova deployment

install:
apt-get python-boto

To run:
python name-of-script.py
